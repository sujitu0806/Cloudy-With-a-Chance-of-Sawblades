# Cloudy-With-a-Chance-of-Sawblades

Project Name: Cloudy With a Chance of SAWBLADES

Project Description: Cloudy With a Chance of SAWLADES is an arcade game based on a pre-existing game, in which a user can move a player to jump and avoid sharp, violently rotating sawblades that are falling from the sky.This version introduces a twist by having golden path-tracking sawblades that follow the player, making the game much more difficult. Additionally, players are allowed to use three umbrellas per game. These umbrellas serve dual purposes: they deflect normal sawblades off their curves and block the vision of the path-tracking sawblades. By manipulating the angle of their umbrella, players can protect themselves from normal sawblades and prevent path-tracking sawblades from identifying the playerâ€™s position.
